 My goal was to build a pilot dashboard in Power BI to help the company understand their sales performance and customer behavior better — as part of a trial for a potential long-term partnership.



▪️ 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄

 I created a 3-page dashboard covering:



1️⃣ 𝙊𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬 – Overall trends by city, age group, and monthly performance

2️⃣ 𝙎𝙖𝙡𝙚𝙨 𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙚 𝘼𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙮𝙨𝙞𝙨 – Performance by sales channels like agents, app,    and website

3️⃣ 𝘼𝙜𝙚 𝙂𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙥 𝘼𝙣𝙖𝙡𝙮𝙨𝙞𝙨 – Which age groups bring in more customers and revenue



▪️  𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀

 ✔️ Direct agents bring the highest revenue, but digital channels are growing

 ✔️ The 31–45 age group is most valuable, while 17–24 has room to grow

 ✔️ Delhi NCR has the most customers; Indore needs more attention
